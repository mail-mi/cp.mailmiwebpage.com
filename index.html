          <h4>Futerror</h4>
          <p>Spencer meets a teenage boy, about his same age, named JJ, and shortly
            afterward, both are taken to the future due to a mysterious pocket
            watch. They find themselves underground where human life struggles to
            survive after an asteroid impact renders the surface of America unlivable.
            They meet Marissa, and the three are sent on a strange quest by a wacky scientist
            named H. C. Krash to create a serum that will make the drinker immune
            to radiation poisoning. Will Spencer and JJ be able to get home before
            the impending war with Europe breaks out? Do they even <em>want</em>
            to get home?</p>
